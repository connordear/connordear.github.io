            Hey! Thanks for visiting my site. I'm currently finishing my final year of Software Engineering at the Lassonde School of Engineering at York University in Toronto.

            <br><br>Outside of class, I'm working as a teaching assistant for a Software Design course, where I've been building lab assignments, writing software specifications, and helping students understand the material. Although the course can be pretty demanding, I'm excited to share my passion for good software design with the next round of students.
            <br><br>
            In my free time you can probably find me trying out a new fitness class or experimenting in the kitchen by attempting to cook the latest Binging with Babish recipe. I'm passionate about learning new things and trying out new experiences, and am looking forward to what my final year has to offer!

            At the beginning of the Summer 2018, I was asked to join the winning team of QCBT. In the span of 2 weeks, we had to create a working prototype of the "Future of Wealth Management" application that the team had created while at the conference. We interviewed branch managers and current users of their platform to gather information on possible improvements, and created a live demo of the application to present to a panel of senior executives at BMO's headquarters in downtown Toronto. For this project I tried out the Ionic framework to get some more experience with the Angular system, using an Express server and MongoDB database in the backend.

              In the Summer of 2018 I performed research in the area of Computer Vision, investigating new ways to calibrate highway monitoring cameras. I developed a calibration algorithm that could accurately estimate camera focal length and tilt angle using known lane-width dimensions and then iteratively estimating parameters. My research was awared 1st honourable mention at the LURA Research conference at the end of the Summer.

          <p class="text">ElleHacks is a women-only hackathon that takes place in the Lassonde School of Engineering. My friend Ramona Sar is the president of the WISE (Women in Science and Engineering) club at Lassonde and asked if I would be able to build the site
            out for her! I think events like these are crucial to helping grow the diversity within the tech world, and worked with a designer (Leena Chanthyvong) to build out the site. This time around I decided to build my own grid system using pure HTML/CSS (using flexbox),
            and was thrilled at how easy it was! This project taught me a lot about the impact that loading JS files can have on the load time for a site, and I was inspired to re-do my webpage with a similar custom grid system. </p>

I met Lynne while working in the prototyping lab at school as she was 3D printing one of her Pillflowers, and with her designs & art, my friend Ken Faria and I developed her app using React-Native. It was developed specifically for iPad, and as a result of the very tight timeline, it is not cross-compatible across devices. Still, it was a great project to work on, and I had a learned a tonne along the way.</p>

The Canadian Satellite Design Club at York was looking for a way to build custom Magnetorquers, essentially finely wrapped wire around a metal core. The station uses a Raspberry Pi to drive two different stepper motors to guide the wire along the core. It was constructed using 3D printed ABS and has an acryllic base. </p>
