          <p class="text">The first freelance gig that I worked on, Pillflower World, is the next stage of Artist <a href="http://www.lynneheller.com/">Lynne Heller's</a> continued work with exploring her Pillflowers. I met Lynne while working in the prototyping lab at school as she was 3D printing one of her Pillflowers, and with her designs & art, my friend Ken Faria and I developed her app using React-Native. It was developed specifically for iPad, and as a result of the very tight timeline, it is not cross-compatible across devices. Still, it was a great project to work on, and I had a learned a tonne along the way. Shout out to React-Native -- shit's good.</p>

          <p class="text">Sewl is a Toronto startup that seeks to continually empower their customers by meeting their individual fashion needs through an interactive shopping experience. I met Ashley, the CEO, while taking part in the YULaunch Accelerator program in
            the summer of 2017. She was looking for someone to design/develop the site - as a big fan of the idea for her company, I was eager to help her out with it. Making use of Bootstrap's form validation, as well as a handy google-apps script to
            handle email sign-ups, the page submits all form data to a google sheets document. I found this to be a handy work around to help save a bit of cash handling form submissions. The site is fully responsive and also makes use of Bootstrap's
            grid system and Scrollspy navigation.</p>

          <p class="text">ElleHacks is a women-only hackathon that takes place in the Lassonde School of Engineering. My friend Ramona Sar is the president of the WISE (Women in Science and Engineering) club at Lassonde and asked if I would be able to build the site
            out for her! I think events like these are crucial to helping grow the diversity within the tech world, and worked with a designer (Leena Chanthyvong) to build out the site. This time around I decided to build my own grid system using pure HTML/CSS (using flexbox),
            and was thrilled at how easy it was! This project taught me a lot about the impact that loading JS bytes can have on the load time for a site, and I was inspired to re-do my webpage with a similar custom grid system. </p>
