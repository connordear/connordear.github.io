[Live Site](https://connordear.ca)

This has been a work in progress for some time, and over time sections have come and gone. It's been a great place for me to try out funky things as I have built up my knowledge of basic HTML/CSS/JS, and I have tried to code as much of it from scratch as possible.

Recent improvements include the addition of modals for the projects section and a crossfade slideshow for a current projects section.

Future Goals for the site:

* Add dark mode
* Include a link to my current top playlist from spotify
* Include currently reading/attempting to cook section
